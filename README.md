Investment strategy tester for better long-term results!

## Motivation

There are plenty of investment strategy testers available, but they are usually lacking some crucial factors that affect the results dramatically. Also they are mostly focusing on short-timeframe trading, rather than long-term investing.

Therefore the question remains:

> Can technical analysis help long-term investors to make better decisions compared to plain and simple dollar cost averaging?

This tool aims to help investors evaluate their thinking, and possibly improve their results as well.
